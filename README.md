# GMM-SLIC-RustDetction
A novel rust segmentation approach based on the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and superpixel segmentation.

Training code, testing code, and testing images are provided. For training images and pre-trained models (including `GMMmodel_RGB.pkl`, `GMMmodel_HSV.pkl`, and `GMMmodel_combine.pkl`), please contact yangzhixinluo@link.cuhk.edu.cn.

## Citation

## Preparation
Install required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Make a new directory `./Output` under the current directory for the output images that will be generated:
```
mkdir Output
```

## Usage of training/testing code
The following files are used to train the GMM model:
* `Train_GMM_RGB.py`: Training code for GMM model using RGB features
* `Train_GMM_HSV.py`: Training code for GMM model using HSV features
* `Train_GMM_Combine.py`: Training code for GMM model using RGB+HSV features

The following files are used to test the GMM model with SLIC superpixel segmentation, and generate output images:
* `Test_RGB_SLIC.py`: Testing code with SLIC segmentation for GMM model using RGB features
* `Test_HSV_SLIC.py`: Testing code with SLIC segmentation for GMM model using HSV features
* `Test_Combine_SLIC.py`: Testing code with SLIC segmentation for GMM model using RGB+HSV features

## Training
Train GMM model using RGB features:
```
python Train_GMM_RGB.py --train_path=<your-training-images-directory-path>
```
Train GMM model using HSV features:
```
python Train_GMM_HSV.py --train_path=<your-training-images-directory-path>
```
Train GMM model using RGB+HSV features:
```
python Train_GMM_Combine.py --train_path=<your-training-images-directory-path>
```
Example:
```
python Train_GMM_HSV.py --train_path="./train_images"
```

## Testing
Test with SLIC segmentation for GMM model using RGB features:
```
python Test_RGB_SLIC.py --test_img_path=<your-testing-image-path>
```
Test with SLIC segmentation for GMM model using HSV features:
```
python Test_HSV_SLIC.py --test_img_path=<your-testing-image-path>
```
Test with SLIC segmentation for GMM model using RGB+HSV features:
```
python Test_Combine_SLIC.py --test_img_path=<your-testing-image-path>
```
Example:
```
python Test_HSV_SLIC.py --test_img_path="./test_images/test1.png"
```

## Output
### Training output
The trained model `.pkl` file (`GMMmodel_RGB.pkl`, `GMMmodel_HSV.pkl`, `GMMmodel_combine.pkl` accordingly) will be generated under the current directory.

### Testing output
All the output images will be generated under `./Output` directory, including (take running `Test_HSV_SLIC.py` as example):
* `HeatMap_GMM_HSV.png`: The heat image (visualized probability) predicted by the GMM model
* `SLIC_Black_HSV.jpg`: The SLIC superpixel segmentation output (black background) of the original input image
* `SLIC_White_HSV.jpg`: The SLIC superpixel segmentation output (white background) of the original input image
* `SLIC_HSV.jpg`: The SLIC superpixel segmentation output (original background) of the original input image
* `Final_Img_HSV.jpg`: The final segmentation output with rust detected in red and original background
* `Binary_Img_HSV.jpg`: The binary segmentation output with rust detected in red and background in white

## Remarks
1. We have supported the image formats including `PNG`, `JPG`, `JPEG`, `png`, `jpg`, `jpeg` for the training and testing images.
2. If your environment does not support GUI display (like when running on remote servers), just comment out all the lines of `cv2.imshow()`, `cv2.waitKey(0)`, `cv2.destroyAllWindows()`.
3. Notice that do not comment out the lines of `cv2.imwrite()`, otherwise you will not get the output images under `./Output` directory.
